Project goal was to understand what node.js is and how the internet works. Good practice on how to create a simple server. Also an intro to to NPM and Express

*Node.js notes*
-V8 Javascript engine used in Google Chrome is fast and can execute thousands of instructions per second
-Node.js encourages asynchronous coding style making for faster code to manage concurrencyt while avoiding multithreaded problems
-Javascript offers node.js access to many useful libraries
-Node.js provides us thge ability tp share code between browser and server since they are both Javascript code.

NPM is an official helper for node projects that comes along with node when we install it
